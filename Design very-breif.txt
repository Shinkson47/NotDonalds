# NotDonalds Very-Brief

Basically, make a Resturant Ordering System

Menu - Tom will decide a menu and save it in a central file with pricings - the system will read from this file which will be ammended as a master 
     - each resturant will use this master file however they will read from their own version, which allows them to update availability items for any reason, eg out of stock

Order taking process

1. Customers come to an ordering desk where they will order from an employee, like fast food  
2. Items will be in categories 'Main' 'Drink' 'Side' 'Dessert'
3. 'Drink' will be split into categories 'Soft Drink' 'Hot Drink' 'Alcoholic Drink'
4. Items can be bought seperately or as a 'Meal'
5. 'Meal' includes 'Main, Drink, and Side' 
6. 'Meal' can be 'Large' or 'Regular'
7. Payment is carried out on the same screen
8. For the purposes of this NotDonalds only accepts cash payment

Hardware spec:

Centralised server with ordering stations connecting to it
Employees will be using touchscreen monitors to input orders for customers

- Design for mobile order implementation possibly
