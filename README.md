# NotDonalds
We made a restaurant ordering system because we were bored.


# Project Brief

Basically, make a Resturant Ordering System

Menu - Tom will decide a menu and save it in a central file with pricings - the system will read from this file which will be ammended as a master - each resturant will use this master file however they will read from their own version, which allows them to update availability items for any reason, eg out of stock

Order taking process

Customers come to an ordering desk where they will order from an employee, like fast food
Items will be in categories 'Main' 'Drink' 'Side' 'Dessert'
'Drink' will be split into categories 'Soft Drink' 'Hot Drink' 'Alcoholic Drink'
Items can be bought seperately or as a 'Meal'
'Meal' includes 'Main, Drink, and Side'
'Meal' can be 'Large' or 'Regular'
Payment is carried out on the same screen
For the purposes of this NotDonalds only accepts cash payment
Hardware spec:

Centralised server with ordering stations connecting to it Employees will be using touchscreen monitors to input orders for customers

Design for mobile order implementation possibly
